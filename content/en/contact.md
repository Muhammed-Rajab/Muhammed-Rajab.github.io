Wanna get in touch? Cool.

1. **Email** – If you're feeling professional or need something serious sorted.

2. **Instagram** – If you want to check out some of my work (and maybe stay for the chaos — you might like it).

3. **Discord** – If, for some reason, you don’t have Instagram or just prefer memes with your messages.

4. **GitHub** – If you're here to snoop around my code or silently judge my commit history. Go ahead

Pick your poison. I’m usually around.
