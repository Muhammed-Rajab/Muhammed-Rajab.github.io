Ah yes, the “About Me” page — where I try to sound interesting without sounding like I’m trying to sound interesting.

I’m a programmer with a borderline obsession for electronics, music, and building things that probably shouldn’t work but somehow do. I also write sometimes, but most of it lives quietly in my notes app, where it can’t bother anyone.

My work? A bit unpredictable. My plans? Mostly vibes. I like making things that excite me — the kind that keep me up at night with just one more idea to try.

I don’t chase perfection — I’d rather build something weird and functional than spend forever polishing a concept into oblivion. Life’s short, and sometimes, chaotic creativity gets you further than overthinking.

If that resonates with you, feel free to say hi.
